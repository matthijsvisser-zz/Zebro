\subsection{Acoustic sensing}

Distance measurement by acoustic signals using time of flight could be a good option for short range localization between 0 and 3 meters. A couple of test where done to test if measuring time of flight of sound waves is suitable for a swarming application. the following points need to be researched:
\begin{itemize}
\item To complement the shortcomings of the far range localization system the signal needs to be able to travel atleast 3 meters.
\item Because the robots need to create awareness to all other robots around, it is important that the waves travel omnidirectional. T
\item To make the localization as accurately as possible there needs to be a minimum of interference. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{frequency ranges}
The speaker used for these test has a frequency range between the ***Hz and **kHz. To test what the influence of different frequencies is on the distance that the waves can travel the following test set-up is used:
*set-up*
Thespeaker is faced directly at the microphone to create an ideal situation.

*meetresultaten*
the higher frequencies are better visible then the lower frequencies. 

\subsubsection{wave characteristics}
To test the spread of the sound waves the speaker was placed on the table facing upwards. On a distance of 1, 2, and 3 meters we placed a microphone, also facing upwards, which was connected to an oscilloscope. For each frequency we tested what the microphone was picking up and how the signal showed up. 
*meetresultaten*
The higher frequencies did not show up at all, while the lower frequencies where easily visible.
  
There are ways to manipulate the direction of the sound waves. If there is need to use frequencies higher than the hearing spectrum. By the use of a parabolic reflector a higher frequency sound beam can be converted to a more omnidirectional wave.


\subsubsection{interference}

Until now only the travel characteristics where tested, but how does the environment have effect on these sound waves. Are the lower or the higher sound waves more more influenced by noise. And if so, can the noise be minimized with filtering.

Filter where implemented to test if the results improved, and if the noise that was added on purpose had any influence on the system. 


\subsubsection{Conslusion}
Lower frequencies have a wider reach than the higher frequencies. But because the higher frequencies have a more narrow beam they have a longer range then the lower frequencies. From this test it can be concluded that lower sound waves are more preferable since it was the intention to have a wave with omnidirectional characteristics and a minimum of 3 meter travel range in those directions.
